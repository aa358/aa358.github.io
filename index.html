                        Hi! My name is Arqam Usman Ali and I am a Web and Information Systems major from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).

                    <p>
                    Throughout my time at NJIT, I have experienced many amazing opportunities. 
                    <br></br>
                    I worked as an Orientation Leader for NJIT's New Student Orientation and guided over 1,600 incoming students to support their educational and personal goals. I also worked as a Peer Mentor at NJIT's Learning Communities where I played a leading role in assisting first year students in navigating their freshman year of college.
                    <br></br>
                    Additionally, I was the volunteer coordinator for Students for Hunger Relief (SFHR) club at NJIT and I managed and facilitated 15 meal-packaging events which resulted in over 1800 meals for homeless shelters in the greater Newark community.
                    <br></br>
                    Most recently, I was a Software Developer intern at Instinet where I designed and developed a centralized data analytics software for Midway, utilizing SQL within Java to analyze work metrics, integrating data into a user-friendly Nivo React interface for interactive charts, and improving work visibility by 50% while enhancing decision-making speed by 30%
                    <br></br>
                    In terms of project experience, I have developed several projects which can be seen below.
                    <br></br>
                    These positions and experiences developed my programming skills and refined my Agile Development skills along with soft skills like time management, collaboration, communication, leadership. I'm looking to make an impact in a software development position that will allow me to apply and further enhance my programming skills.

                                    <b>-- NJIT YWCC Spring 2024 Capstone 3rd Place Panel Winner -- </b>
                                    <br> </br>
                                    For my senior capstone project at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), I led a team of four to develop an AI Copilot for PyMOL, a drug visualization software widely used in biology labs. 
                                    The project was inspired by my roommate, who worked in NJITâ€™s biology lab and faced challenges mastering PyMOLâ€™s complex interface, which typically required 4â€“6 weeks of training for new hires. 
                                    <br></br>
                                    To address this issue, we envisioned a solution leveraging GPT-4's API to simplify workflows and reduce the learning curve. 
                                    By enabling users to interact with PyMOL through natural language commands, the AI Copilot translated user input into backend functions, making the software more accessible and significantly enhancing its usability. 
                                    The final product streamlined molecule visualization, accelerating viewing processes by 6 times and property analysis by 2 times, as reported by researchers.
                                    <br></br>
                                    In my role as project manager and backend developer, I guided the team through four months of development, organizing sprints, conducting daily scrum meetings, and ensuring timely progress. 
                                    I also played a key role in implementing the backend by training GPT-4â€™s API in Python to map natural language inputs to PyMOL's plugin library functions. 
                                    While a teammate focused on creating a user-friendly chat interface with PyQt, I collaborated closely with the backend team to ensure seamless integration and functionality. 
                                    Our projectâ€™s success was highlighted by earning third place at the Capstone Showcase, underscoring the innovation and impact of our work.

                                    A software development project that automates the process of sending random messages to a Discord channel. The project integrates the Discord API, utilizes Python libraries like `Faker` to generate realistic random content, and implements automated testing with `pytest`. 
                                    The solution includes a structured directory setup with folders for the main application logic (`discordmsg`) and automated testing (`tests`). Key features include dynamically generated payloads, API integration, and robust testing to validate functionality.
                                    <br> </br>
                                    Whether you're looking to automate tasks in Discord or learn how to work with APIs and Python testing frameworks, this project offers a practical, hands-on experience. Dive into the code to explore a real-world example of API usage, random data generation, and test-driven development!

                                        Students for Hunger Relief (SFHR) is a student-run organization at NJIT dedicated to addressing hunger in Newark through large-scale, on-campus initiatives. SFHR collaborates with charitable organizations to acquire food and organizes meal packaging events where hundreds of meals are prepared by volunteers. These meals are then distributed to shelters and locations in Newark such as Penn Station, Lincoln Park, and Covenant House, helping to connect NJIT students with the local community.

                                        I was an Volunteer Coordinator for Students for Hunger Relief from 2022 to 2024. During this time, I helped organize and manage 15 meal packaging events, resulting in over 1,800 meals being distributed to homeless shelters in Newark.

                                                My responsibilities included coordinating logistics, managing volunteers, and ensuring smooth operations during the events. The meals packaged ranged from rice and chicken to beef chili and salads, all sourced from 501(c)(3) accredited organizations.
